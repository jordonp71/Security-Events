# Container Security Scanner project

This Container Security Scanner project is a Python script designed for assessing the security of container images. Leveraging Trivy for vulnerability scanning, the script identifies and reports security vulnerabilities in containerized environments. It provides detailed CSV reports for in-depth vulnerability analysis, aiding in prompt remediation. The script integrates seamlessly with Splunk via HTTP Event Collector (HEC), enabling the centralized logging of security events. With enhanced error handling, sophisticated reporting, and integration capabilities, this project aims to be a production-ready solution for ensuring container security and facilitating seamless integration with popular security information and event management (SIEM) systems like Splunk.
